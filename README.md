# Maze Generator and Solver

This project generates mazes using the Randomized Prim’s algorithm and solves them using A* and BFS pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- Maze generation with Randomized Prim’s algorithm
- Maze solving using A* and BFS algorithms
- Visualization of maze generation and solving process
- Supports configurable maze sizes
- Educational tool for graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: [e.g., Python, Java, C++]
